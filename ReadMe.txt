this code is coded by Pouya Mohammady! 9829039
it is tested by linux and code by vs code!
..............
just in case : it is better not to be compiled by Clion! :))
..............
if IDs are less then 10 char , 0 will be added to the first part
like 1 is 0000000001
remember it is at most with 10 char! 
so your 'input' ID must be less or equal to 10 :))
..............
alse if you want to delete a vote you must enter its ID!
..............
I dont think it will be compiled on MAC os because 
I have used the system("") to clean the terminal 
but i tried to make it flexiable so it maybe work on mac! :))
but i recommend it to be compiled with linux gnu!
use this code in linux terminal:

gcc -o main main.c
./main

...............
remember to have "teamNames.txt" in the same folder as main.c!

thanks
